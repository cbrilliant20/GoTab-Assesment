A GET method is used to request data from a server through an API. I would consider a GET if the app called for data from a third-party API and we did not want to send any changes back to the server. A weather app for example. A GET is typically faster than a POST request, and but can only have string values.

A POST method is a request to send data to a server through an API.  I would consider it if a user needs to create data that I would want to store. An example would be a saving a users display name in an app.  A POST is typically slower because of the new data that needs to be sent and no length restrictions, but data is not sent publicly in the url header.
