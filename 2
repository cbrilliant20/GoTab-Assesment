I would create a new database table for commission and give it:

COMMISSION_RECORD_ID (PK)
SALES_RECORD_ID (FK)
AGENT_ID (FK)
AMOUNT

COMMISSION would have a one to one relationship with SALES_RECORDS and a one to many with SALES_AGENTS.

See this mock for more context... I am not totally confident I set my lines and arrows exactly correct but it is a general idea.
